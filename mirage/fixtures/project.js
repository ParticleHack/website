    Finding detailed documentation for how to build a cyclotron is challenging because in practice,
    building one is a series of compromises based around an original idea. You’ll need to learn the physics
    concepts reasonably well to get the whole thing operational. However, read the links below, and you’ll start to
    get a sense for what you have to do. And remember that the Cyclotron Kids did it!</p>`

    particles by electromagnetic fields. One way to show this on the macro scale is to
    accelerate a ping pong ball around a glass bowl by using conductive tape to provide the pushes and pulls.
    There are a series of designs available, some of which use van de Graaf generators to provide the strong
    electric fields, while others use electrical transformers. Have a look at some of the options

    and <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/flavours-of-physics"> using LHCb data to look for signs of new physics</a>.
    Most winning solutions tend to use convolutional neural networks

    to iterate toward an easier build that more reliable with better results.
