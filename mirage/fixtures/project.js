    pretty common particles in nature, especially from
    cosmic rays, but also often used in the detection of
    neutrinos and other particles. However, muon
    detectors have traditionally been a complex piece of
    machinery to manufacture. This design shows how to make
    your own desktop muon detector for about 100 USD.</p>`

    Finding detailed documentation for how to build a cyclotron is challenging because in practice,
    building one is a series of compromises based around an original idea. You’ll need to learn the physics
    concepts reasonably well to get the whole thing operational. However, read the links below, and you’ll start to
    get a sense for what you have to do. And remember that the Cyclotron Kids did it!</p>`

    particles by electromagnetic fields. One way to show this on the macro scale is to
    accelerate a ping pong ball around a glass bowl by using conductive tape to provide the pushes and pulls.
    There are a series of designs available, some of which use van de Graaf generators to provide the strong
    electric fields, while others use electrical transformers. Have a look at some of the options
    linked below before deciding which version suits you best.</p>`

    challenges in which you can win money for the best solutions to the problems on offer.
    Past challenges have included <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson">using ATLAS data to find the Higgs Boson</a>
    and <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/flavours-of-physics"> using LHCb data to look for signs of new physics</a>.
    Most winning solutions tend to use convolutional neural networks
    plus a combination of other ideas, but you often don’t need to know much of the physics involved.
    Learning it is just a fun bonus!</p>`
